<BR>

</UL>
For completeness sake, you can still download the previous version here (but really ... why should you?)
<BR>

<P>
<H2>Java Runtime Environment</H2>
You also need Java 2 for running Bots'n'Scouts. We recommend Version 1.3 for
V0.8pre, but it should be running under V1.2, too. If you haven't got a JRE or
JDK for Java 2 installed, you may get it from the following location: <UL>
<LI> <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/jre"> 
JRE for Windows 95/98/NT/Linux/Solaris V1.3</A>
</LI>
</UL>
For V0.7.1 you will need need Version 1.2 of Java 2. If you haven't got a JRE or JDK for Java 2, V1.2 and still want to run Bots'N'Scouts V0.7.1, you may get it from the following locations:
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html">JRE for LinuxV1.2</A>(11MB)
</LI>
<LI> <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/download-windows.html"> 
JRE for Windows 95/98/NT V1.2</A>

<H2>For the Brave and Experienced Only</H2>
If you are a developer yourself and if maybe there was a long time no release from us, you may want to risk a look into our CVS-repository. Read <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3883">how to access</a> it and if you have got ant installed simply type "ant run".

Sorry, the code is not easy to read because a) we were not as good as now when we started the project and b) huge chunks are still in German. We are working on it...
