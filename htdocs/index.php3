Robots make a race through an old factory. Robots don't move like human beings would do - they have to be programmed and execute their programm afterwards.
Bad luck if some other robot comes along and pushes you - your programm will still be executed... And maybe you'll race faster if you use the conveyer belts... And don't fall into pits!

The game is inspired by the board game Roborally by Wizards of the Coast(TM).
Bots'n'Scouts is based on the idea of the game, but it's different. 
It is a much faster game (thanks to our scout). Roborally is more communicative and has more challenges like option cards that e.g. provide weapons.

We like both - you should find out yourself: The board game was originally 
published in the U.S. from 
<A HREF="http://www.wizards.com/roborally">Wizards of The Coast</A> (TM).
In Germany it's distributed by <A HREF="http://www.amigo-spiele.de">Amigo-Spiele</A>.

There're lots of other websites to find out more about Roborally. The best place to start is the one from <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/eflod/">Eric Floderus</A>.
