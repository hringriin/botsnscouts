<h2>News</h2>
There really are fans out there! Jude provided <A HREF="rules.php3">a manual</A>!
<P>
And earlier this month something wonderful has happened: it was nearly nine'o'clock in the morning and we proudly presented:
<b>Bots'N'Scouts V0.8pre</b>: the result of another night of hard work. Some things
are new, some are more beautiful (it overall is), some are faster and some need
less memory - and the download-size increased: What would you expect more from
a new release? :-) There still is some finetuning to be done until we call it
V0.8, nevertheless we feel that this <b>is worth</b> releasing, since it's usable,
pretty, quick and much better than V0.7.1. Outstanding new features are:
<ul>
<li> Sound! Adds a lot of fun ...
<li> Chat! Just hit ENTER to send a message to other players
<li> Zoom! Choose yor personal magnification factor
</ul>

<h2>For those who don't know yet:</h2>

Robots make a race through an old factory. Robots don't move like human beings would do - they have to be programmed and execute their programm afterwards.
Bad luck if some other robot comes along and pushes you - your programm will still be executed... And maybe you'll race faster if you use the conveyer belts... And don't fall into pits!
<P>
The game is inspired by the board game Roborally by Wizards of the Coast(TM).
Bots'n'Scouts is based on the idea of the game, but it's different. 
It is a much faster game (thanks to our scout). Roborally is more communicative and has more challenges like option cards that e.g. provide weapons.
<P>
We like both - you should find out yourself: The board game was originally 
published in the U.S. from 
<A HREF="http://www.wizards.com/roborally">Wizards of The Coast</A> (TM).
In Germany it's distributed by <A HREF="http://www.amigo-spiele.de">Amigo-Spiele</A>.
<BR>
There're lots of other websites to find out more about Roborally. The best place to start is the one from <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/eflod/">Eric Floderus</A>.
