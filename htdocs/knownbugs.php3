<H1>Known Bugs and other things to do</H1>
</CENTER>
We prefer to be told about bugs and problems via the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3883&atid=103883">bug tracking system</A> at Sourceforge.<P>
You may tell your wishes for future releases to the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=353883&group_id=3883&func=browse">Feature Tracker</A>.
<P>
But you may use classical <a href="mailto:botsnscouts-devel@lists.sf.net">e-mail</a> as well.<BR>
<H2>Known Bugs in 0.8.*</H2>
<UL>
<LI>On real multi-user operating systems you cannot save tiles if you haven't installed Bots'n'Scouts yourself.
<LI>Layout still is nicer with higher monitor resolution. 800 x 600 causes some minor problems.
<LI>Disconnecting during a game may cause problems
<LI>The limitation to a maximum of 6 flags and 8 players applies to V0.8pre, too.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>There are more things to do...</H2>
We still are currently working on:
<UL>
<LI>more sounds
<LI>refactoring our source code which has a lot of cruft
<LI>in the long term: option cards
<LI>more cool features (know of any? <a href="mailto:botsnscouts-devel@lists.sorceforge.net">contact</a> us!)
</UL>
<H2>Known Bugs in V0.7.1: (Don't use it anymore!)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>There appear to be problems occuring only with JDK1.3! <BR>Try JDK1.2 or wait until we fixed it, sorry.  
<LI>On real multi-user operating systems you cannot save tiles if you haven't installed Bots'n'Scouts yourself.
<LI>Sometimes the scrollbars don't work. Try resizing the window or use the right mouse button to scroll.
<LI>Layout is nicer with higher monitor resolution. 800 x 600 causes some minor problems.
<LI>Adjust the size of the board and the number of auto-bots to the power of your computer. 
<LI>Confirming "game over" at the end of the game _IMMEDIATELY_ stops everything,
including the server. Don't confirm if the other players want to continue. 
<LI>You may set only up to six flags and no more than eight players. The names must not contain anything but letters from 'A' to 'z', sorry.
<LI>Linux: "fullscreen.sh" is experimental. Read README.fullscreen which comes with your distribution.
<LI> We haven't written FAQ yet.
