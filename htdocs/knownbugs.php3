<H1>Known Bugs and other things to do</H1>
</CENTER>
<H2>Known Bugs:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> !!! There appear to be problems with JDK1.3  !!! <BR>Try JDK1.2 or wait until we fixed it, sorry.
<LI>On real multi-user operating systems you cannot save tiles if you haven't installed Bots'n'Scouts yourself.
<LI>Sometimes the scrollbars don't work. Try resizing the window or use the right mouse button to scroll.
<LI>Layout is nicer with higher monitor resolution. 800 x 600 causes some minor problems.
<LI>Adjust the size of the board and the number of auto-bots to the power of your computer. 
<LI>Confirming "game over" at the end of the game _IMMEDIATELY_ stops everything,
including the server. Don't confirm if the other players want to continue. 
<LI>You may set only up to six flags and no more than eight players. The names must not contain anything but letters from 'A' to 'z', sorry.
<LI>Linux: "fullscreen.sh" is experimental. Read README.fullscreen which comes with your distribution.
<LI> We haven't written FAQ yet.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>There are more things to do...</H2>
We are currently working on:
<UL>
<LI>reducing the need of system ressources,
<LI>sound,
<LI>handling timeouts (if AutoRobs don't manage to make their move in time)
<LI>refactoring our source code which has a lot of cruft...
<LI>cool features of course
</UL>
