Installing and starting instructions for Bots'n'Scouts
------------------------------------------------------

Generic installation instructions:
1. Check whether you have a Java 1.2 or later Runtime Environment installed.
   If not, download and install it:
   Linux:<"http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html">
   Windows 95/98/NT: 	
   <"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html"> (8MB)
2. There are two kinds of distribution: the binary-only and the source 
   distribution. They are called "botsnscouts-<ver>.zip" and 
   "botsnscouts-<ver>-src.zip", respectively. Download one of these. 
   Probably you've done that already.
3. Unpack it in any place you like. 



Starting Instructions:
GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like OSes:

Change the working directory to where you installed Bots'n'Scouts.

"start.sh" will start the game.
"tileeditor.sh" will start the tile editor.

Note: You cannot symlink to these files and expect that to work; the
location of the Bots'n'Scouts binaries is determined relative to the
position of the command executed. Please create a file like this instead:

#!/bin/sh
exec /path/to/start.sh

and put that into the desired bin/ - directory.

"fullscreen.sh" starts up a new X server without a window manager and run 
Bots 'n' Scouts in fullscreen mode. This might only work as root, depending on 
your distribution (works as non-root in SuSE, doesn't in debian). Will probably 
only work under Linux. If your system lacks memory (<64MB) it may be helpful 
not starting a window manager but starting fullscreen.sh from console only.
If you don't understand this, don't worry and use "start.sh"


Windows:

There are batch files for starting up the game or the tile editor.
These files are: "start.bat" to start the game and "tileeditor" to create 
your own tiles.

No real fullscreen mode, sorry.

Note: You cannot link to these files and expect that to work. The location
of the Bots'n'Scouts binaries is determined by the current working directory
of the process. Create a .bat file like this instead:

C:
cd \path\to\botsnscouts
start.bat

and link to that.
