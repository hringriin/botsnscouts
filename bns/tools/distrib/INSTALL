Installing and starting instructions for Bots'n'Scouts

Generic installation instructions:
1. Check whether you have a Java 1.2 Runtime Environment installed.
   If not, download and install it:
   Linux:<"http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html">
   Windows 95/98/NT: 	
   <"http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/download-windows.html"> (8MB)
2. There are two kinds of distribution: the binary-only and the source 
   distribution. They are called "botsnscouts-<ver>.zip" and 
   "botsnscouts-<ver>-src.zip", respectively. Download one of these. 
   Probably you've done that already.
3. Unpack it in any place you like. 



Starting Instructions:
GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like OSes:

Change the working directory to where you installed Bots'n'Scouts.

"start.sh" will start the game, in the language specified in the file "language". 
That may be either "english" or "deutsch".

"tileeditor.sh" will start the tile editor in the language specified in "language".

"fullscreen.sh" starts up a new X server without a window manager and run 
Bots 'n' Scouts in fullscreen mode. This might only work as root, depending on 
your distribution (works as non-root in SuSE, doesn't in debian). Will probably 
only work under Linux. If your system lacks memory (<64MB) it may be helpful 
not starting a window manager but starting fullscreen.sh from console only.
If you don't understand this, don't worry and use "start.sh"


Windows:

There are batch files for starting up the game or the tile editor in either 
english or german.
These files are: "start-english.bat" and "start-german.bat" to start the game and
"tileeditor-english.bat" and "tileeditor-german.bat" to create your own tiles.

No real fullscreen mode, sorry.
