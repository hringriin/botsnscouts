                     ***** Bots'n'Scouts Version 0.7 *****
          An addictive multiplayer networked strategy game for Java.

Robots make a race through an old factory. Robots don't move like human beings
would do - they have to be programmed and execute their programm afterwards.
Bad luck if some other robot comes along and pushes you - your programm will
still be executed... And maybe you'll race faster if you use the conveyer
belts... And don't fall into pits!

The game is inspired by the board game Roborally by Wizards of the Coast(TM).
Bots'n'Scouts is based on the idea of the game, but it's different. It is a
much faster game (thanks to our scout). Roborally is more communicative and has
more challenges like option cards that e.g. provide weapons.

We like both - you should find out yourself: The board game was originally
published in the U.S. from Wizards of The Coast (TM). In Germany it's
distributed by Amigo-Spiele.

There's lots of other websites to find out more about Roborally. The best place
to start is the one from Eric Floderus <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/eflod">.

The the file INSTALL which came with your distribution explains how to install
and start the game.
