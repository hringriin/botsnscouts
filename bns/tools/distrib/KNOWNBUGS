Bots'n'Scouts

                ****** Known Bugs and other things to do ******

KNOWN BUGS:

    * On real multi-user operating systems you cannot save tiles if you haven't
      installed Bots'n'Scouts yourself.
    * Sometimes the scrollbars don't work. Try resizing the window or use the
      right mouse button to scroll.
    * Layout is nicer with higher monitor resolution. 800 x 600 causes some
      minor problems.
    * Adjust the size of the board and the number of auto-bots to the power of
      your computer.
    * Confirming "game over" at the end of the game _IMMEDIATELY_ stops
      everything, including the server. Don't confirm if the other players want
      to continue.
    * You may set only up to six flags and no more than eight players. The
      names mustn't contain anything but letters from 'A' to 'z', sorry.
    * Linux: "fullscreen.sh" is experimental. Read README.fullscreen which
      comes with your distribution.
    * We haven't written an FAQ yet.


WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON:

    * reducing the need for system ressources,
    * sound,
    * handling timeouts (if AutoRobs don't manage to make their move in time)
    * refactoring our source code which has a lot of cruft...
    * cool features
