Bots'n'Scouts

                ****** Known Bugs and other things to do ******

KNOWN BUGS:

    * On real multi-user operating systems you cannot save tiles if you haven't
      installed Bots'n'Scouts yourself.
    * Layout is nicer with higher monitor resolution. 800 x 600 causes some
      minor problems.
    * Adjust the size of the board and the number of auto-bots to the power of
      your computer.
    * You may set only up to six flags and no more than eight players. The
      names mustn't contain anything but letters from 'A' to 'z', sorry.
    * Linux: "fullscreen.sh" is experimental. Read README.fullscreen which
      comes with your distribution.
