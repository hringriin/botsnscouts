Bots'n'Scouts

                       ****** System Requirements ******

Since Bots'n'Scouts is entirely written in Java, it runs under any system
(Linux, Windows, Solaris...) as long as you meet the hardware requirements.


HARDWARE:

We recommend 64MB memory (tested for Linux and Windows.) As usual, the more the
better...

We tested with 48MB under Linux,too. Instead of starting a window manager
manually, start Bots'n'Scouts via "fullscreen.sh" from console. (But
"fullscreen.sh" is experimental, see README.fullscreen.)

We tested with 32MB but we cannot recommend it.

Bots'n'Scouts uses 2MB of disk space installed.

Your monitor resolution should be at least 800x600, higher recommended.

SOFTWARE:

Besides the Bots'n'Scout distribution you also need a Java Runtime Environment,
version 1.2.
For downloading we recommend
<"http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html"> for Linux and

<"http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/download-windows.html"> for 
Windows 95/98/NT.
