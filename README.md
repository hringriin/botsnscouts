# botsnscouts
Tried to migrate our ancient sourceforge CVS repo to git(hub) from <br>
https://sourceforge.net/projects/botsnscouts/ <br>
Seems to have worked.

The sourcecode can be found in the bns folder.<br>
Or rather: <br>
"bns" is (among other things..) the source folder, with "de" being the main package which contains all the Java sources.

If you've got Apache Ant installed, it should be possible to start the current development state of the game by changing into the "bns" folder and executing "ant run".
